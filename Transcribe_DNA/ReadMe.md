### Problem Definition

An RNA string is a string formed from the alphabet containing `A`, `C`, `G`, and `U`.

Given a DNA string `t` corresponding to a coding strand, its transcribed RNA string `u` is formed by replacing all occurrences of `T` in `t` with `U` in `u`.


#### Given: A DNA string `t` having length at most `1000` nt.

#### Return: The transcribed RNA string of `t`
