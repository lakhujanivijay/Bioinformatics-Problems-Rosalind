### Problem Definition

In DNA strings, symbols `A` and `T` are complements of each other, as are `C` and `G`.

The reverse complement of a DNA string `s` is the string sc formed by reversing the symbols of `s`, then taking the complement of each symbol (e.g., the reverse complement of `GTCA` is `TGAC`).

Given: A DNA string s of length at most `1000` bp.

Return: The reverse complement `sc` of `s`
