#### Simlation of inverted translocation

A "glocal" alignment between two sequences is a series of operations that transform one sequence into the other. The necessary set of operations includes insertions, deletions, point mutations, inversions, translocations and duplications. This program simulates addition of reverse complementary sub sequence to a desired location simulating inverted translocation
and then generating random reads out of the new sequence.
